# `seqcli` [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/sc3iacxwxqqfjgdh/branch/dev?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/datalust/seqcli/branch/dev) [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/datalust/seqcli.svg)](https://github.com/datalust/seqcli/releases)

The [Seq](https://getseq.net) client command-line app. Supports logging (`seqcli log`), searching (`search`), tailing (`tail`), querying (`query`) and [JSON log file](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-formatting-compact) ingestion (`ingest`).

## Getting started

Install or unzip the [release for your operating system](https://github.com/datalust/seqcli/releases).

To set a default server URL, run:

```
seqcli config -k connection.serverUrl -v https://your-seq-server
```

The API key will be stored in your `SeqCli.json` configuration file; on Windows, this is encrypted using DPAPI; on Mac/Linux the key is currently stored in plain text. As an alternative to storing the API key in configuration, it can be passed to each command via the `--apikey=` argument.

## Extraction patterns

The `seqcli ingest` command can be used for parsing plain text logs into structured log events.

```shell
seqcli ingest -x "{@t:timestamp} [{@l:ident}] {@m:*}{:n}{@x:*}"
```

The `-x` argument above is an _extraction pattern_ that will parse events like:

```
2018-02-21 13:29:00.123 +10:00 [ERR] The operation failed
System.DivideByZeroException: Attempt to divide by zero
  at SomeClass.SomeMethod()
```

### Syntax

Extraction patterns have a simple high-level syntax:

 * Text that appears in the pattern is matched literally - so a pattern like `Hello, world!` will match logging statements that are made up of this greeting only,
 * Text between `{curly braces}` is a _match expression_ that identifies a part of the event to be extracted, and
 * Literal curly braces are escaped by doubling, so `{{` will match the literal text `{`, and `}}` matches `}`.
 
Match expressions have the form:

```
{name:matcher}
```

Both the name and matcher are optional, but either one or the other must be specified. Hence `{@t:timestamp}` specifies a name of `@t` and value `timestamp`, `{IPAddress}` specifies a name only, and `{:n}` a value only (in this case the built-in newline matcher).

The _name_ is the property name to be extracted; there are four built-in property names that get special handling:

 * `@t` - the event's timestamp
 * `@m` - the textual message associated with the event
 * `@l` - the event's level
 * `@x` - the exception or backtrace associated with the event
 
Other property names are attached to the event payload, so `{Elapsed:dec}` will extract a property called `Elapsed`, using the `dec` decimal matcher.

Match expressions with no name are consumed from the input, but are not added to the event payload.

### Matchers

Matchers identify chunks of the input event.

Different matchers are needed so that a piece of text like `200OK` can be separated into separate properties, i.e. `{StatusCode:nat}{Status:alpha}`. Here, the `nat` (natural number) matcher also coerces the result into a numeric value, so that it is attached to the event payload numerically as `200` instead of as the text `"200"`.

There are three kinds of matchers:

 * Matchers like `alpha` and `nat` are built-in _named_ matchers.
 * The special matchers `*`, `**` and so-on, are _non-greedy content_ matchers; these will match any text up until the next pattern element matches (`*`), the next two elements match, and so-on. We saw this in action with the `{@m:*}{:n}` elements in the example - the message is all of the text up until the next newline.
 * More complex _compound_ matchers are described using a sub-expression. These are prefixed with an equals sign `=`, like `{Phone:={:nat}-{:nat}-{:nat}}`. This will extract chunks of text like `123-456-7890` into the `Phone` property.

### Processing

Extraction patterns are processed from left to right. When the first non-matching pattern is encountered, extraction stops; any remaining text that couldn't be matched will be attached to the resulting event in an `@unmatched` property.

Multi-line events are handled by looking for lines that start with the first element of the extraction pattern to be used. This works well if the first line of each event begins with something unambiguous like an `iso8601dt` timestamp; if the lines begin with less specific syntax, the first few elements of the extraction pattern might be grouped to identify the start of events more accurately:

```
{:=[{@t} {@l}]} {@m:*}
```

Here the literal text `[`, a timestamp token, adjacent space ` `, level and closing `]` are all grouped so that they constitute a single logical pattern element to identify the start of events.

When logs are streamed into `seqcli ingest` in real time, a 10 ms deadline is applied, within which any trailing lines that make up the event must be received.

### Examples

**Tail systemd logs:**

```shell
journalctl -f -n 0 |
  seqcli ingest -x "{@t:syslogdt} {host} {ident:*}: {@m:*}{:n}" --invalid-data=ignore
```

**Tail `/var/log/syslog`**

```shell
tail -c 0 -F /var/log/syslog |
  seqcli ingest -x "{@t:syslogdt} {host} {ident:*}: {@m:*}{:n}"
```
